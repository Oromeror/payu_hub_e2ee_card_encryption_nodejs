    It should appear (venv) in the console. Whenever a new console is executed, the virtual machine has a libraries and dependencies other than those found in the normal Windows environment, this to maintain the integrity of the applications in the operating system.

- Install nodeenv

    Linux/Mac ```pip install nodeenv```

- Install dependencies

    Linux/Mac ```npm install```

## Execution

- With the virtual environment activated, run the following console command:

    ```npm run dev```

# PayU Hub E2EE example with Node.js

This project was generated making use of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

This repository is based on the implementation of a very simple Node.js API implementation of PayU Hub [End To End Encryption](https://developers.paymentsos.com/docs/security/e2ee.html).

## Requirements

- Python for virtual environment (optional).
- NodeJS

## Installation

- Create a [virtual environment](https://pypi.org/project/nodeenv/) with the command

    #### Local installation
    Linux/Mac 
    ```virtualenv env```

- Activate the virtual environment:

    Linux/Mac ```. env/bin/activate```

    It should appear (venv) in the console. Whenever a new console is executed, the virtual machine has a libraries and dependencies other than those found in the normal Windows environment, this to maintain the integrity of the applications in the operating system.

- Install nodeenv

    Linux/Mac ```pip install nodeenv```

- Install dependencies

    Linux/Mac ```npm install```

## Execution

- With the virtual environment activated, run the following console command:

    ```npm run dev```

    for root request ```http://localhost:port/```
